# Pewlett-Hackard Employee Data Exploration

In this challenge, I used PostgreSQL via pgAdmin4 to create, read, and explore tables of data relating to the employees of Pewlett-Hackard in the 1980s and 1990s. 

Many thanks are due for those that encountered the errors so I didn't have to: Kevin Lindstam and Nathan-Andrew Tompkins.
Thank you to Megan Romano for the solution to getting the data read in, and teaching me about composite primary keys. 

In this exploration, we take a look at: 
1. Salaries of each employee
2. Names and hire dates of employees hired in 1986
3. The managers of each department and pertinent information about them
4. The department for each employee, along with pertinent information about each employee
5. Finding all employees named Hercules B. 
6. Listing out all employees in the Sales department
7. Listing employees in the Sales or Development departments
8. Listing the frequency in descending order of all employees' last names

Also included in this repository is a Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) of the relationships between each table, and the SQL script for the creation of those tables with the correct relationships.
